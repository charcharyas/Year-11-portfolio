        <h1>turnover</h1>
        <h2>Devalopment</h2>
        <p> I made a two point turnaround of my low polygon character.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>testing</h2>
        <p>I quite liked the way the legs turned out in the side view, However im not to happy about the legs in the front view</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>feedback</h2>
        <p>Robert- "move the legs further back." <br>
           Henrey- "move the beak down" <br>
           Connie- "the front view feet should be better"
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>inprovment</h2>
        <p> I changed these thing to make my character look better and make it function better.</p>
<br>

<h1>Legs</h1>
        <h2>Devalopment</h2>
        <p> I made legs for my low poly character</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>testing</h2>
        <p> The feet were quite hard to do and somthing I would focus on more for a high poly character
            but I was quite happy with the rest.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>feedback</h2>
        <p>Suzie- "make the legs more detailed" <br>
           Robert- "Dont use so many polygons in the feet" <br>
           Victor- "squark"
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>inprovment</h2>
        <p>Although I didn't want to add more pologons to the legs because this is a low poly character
            I did remove some of the polygons from the feet
        </p>    
<h1>Wings</h1> 
        <h2>Devalopment</h2>
        <p>I made wings for my low poly character</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>testing</h2>
        <p>The wings took the longest to make of all the bird. I over complicated the makeing of the bird a lot but im quite happy with it.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>feedback</h2>
        <p>Robert- "there are quite a few gaps in the model.
           Henrey- "there are too many pologons"
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>inprovment</h2>
        <p>I closed up the gaps on the wings.</p>
