        <h1>end users</h1>
        <p>My end users are tennages of all genders from the age of 13 to 17. I choose tennages because I want to give them a simple game 
          that they can play on the go. The game could also be super competitive with friends competing agaist each other witch conpetitive teenages would love.
          However the game could also be played by yourself if you are somone who like a more chill exsperiance.
          The game would also be targeted at english speaking countrys since the game would be in english. </p>
        <br>

        <h1>implications</h1>
        <h2>Describe</h2>
        <p> The implications are usablity, asteticts, functionality and interlectual property. astetics is how the game looks and the overall vibe of the game. 
          functionality is weather or not your game actually works and there are little to no bugs. Usablity is how easy your game is to use.
           finally interlectual property is the legel owner ship of an idear. </p>
        <h2>adress</h2>
        <h3>usablity</h3>
        <p> To make sure that my games usablity efficent, I will focus of the controlls of my character and make them hard and difficult to play with for unique gameplay.
          I can acheive by making my character a bird and having to controll every aspect of the wings.
        </p>
        <h3>astetics</h3>
        <p> for astetics I will try and make the character in a unique style so people are drawn to unique gamplay and artstyle.
           I will acheive this by giving my characters a body a bird body but with giant eyes.</p>
        <h3>functionality</h3>
        <p>To make sure that functionality is working well, I will get people to test the character, watch the animation and make the people give me feedback on
          what I could do to make it work better.
        </p>
        <h3>interlectual property</h3>
        <p>With interlectual property I personly don't mind if other people take my modles just as long as they say it was made by me.</p>
