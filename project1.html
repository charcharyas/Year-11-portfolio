        <h1>end users</h1>
        <p>My end users are tennages of all genders from the age of 13 to 17. I choose tennages because I want to give them a simple game 
          that they can play on the go. The game could also be super competitive with friends competing agaist each other witch conpetitive teenages would love.
          However the game could also be played by yourself if you are somone who like a more chill exsperiance.
          The game would also be targeted at english speaking countrys since the game would be in english. </p>
        <br>

        <h1>implications</h1>
        <h2>Describe</h2>
        <p> The implications are usablity, astetics and functionality. astetics is how the game looks and the overall vibe of the game. 
          functionality is weather or not your game actually works and there are little to no bugs. Finally usablity is how easy your game is to use.</p>
