        <h1>overveiw</h1>
        <p> For this project I was tasked with making a charater for a game, it's gonna be a little goober who has silly floppy phsiycs.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1>Requirements</h1>
        <ul>
          <h3>Story parths</h3>
          <li>3 seperate paths</li>
          <li> each path can lead to diffrend endings</li>
          <li> the paths affect gamplay overall</li>
          <h3>location</h3>
          <li> There will be quite a few locations</li>
          <li> There will be diffrent enemys for the diffrent places</li>
         <h3>Enemy/bosses</h3>
          <li>There will be diffrent kinds of enemys with diffrent stats</li>
          <l1>there will be a big boss at the end and potentialy one in the middle</l1>
          <li> The diffrent story parths affect the diffrent kinds enemys</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1>end users</h1>
        <p> The end users for the game are teenagers who have specific needs.
            To keep them engaged, the game must be enjoyable from start to finish,
             as they get bored easily. It should be of a reasonable length because
              short games often miss important elements. Offering various paths, options,
            and unique enemies will make the game more interesting.</p>
        <br>

        <h1>implications</h1>
        <h2>functionality</h2>
        <p>We will test the game when changes are made so we can know if that game is working intended and we will add functions and lists so if there are errors, they will be easier to fix.</p>
        <h2>adress</h2>
        <h3>usablity</h3>
        <p> For usability we will make sure that there is a list of inputs that you can choose from so you know what your doing. We will also add a help input that can help you out if needed
        </p>
        <h3>astetics</h3>
        <p> fot astetics We will change the color of the text so it's easiyer to read and we will also make sure there is good spacing between the lines so it's not so cramped</p>
