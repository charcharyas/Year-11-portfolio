        <h1>overveiw</h1>
        <p> For this project I was tasked with making a charater for a game, it's gonna be a little goober who has silly floppy phsiycs.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1>Requirements</h1>
        <ul>
          <h3>Story parths</h3>
          <li>3 seperate paths</li>
          <li> each path can lead to diffrend endings</li>
          <li> the paths affect gamplay overall</li>
          <h3>location</h3>
          <li> There will be quite a few locations</li>
          <li> There will be diffrent enemys for the diffrent places</li>
         <h3>Enemy/bosses</h3>
          <li>There will be diffrent kinds of enemys with diffrent stats</li>
          <l1>there will be a big boss at the end and potentialy one in the middle</l1>
          <li> The diffrent story parths affect the diffrent kinds enemys</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1>end users</h1>
        <p> The end users for the game are teenagers who have specific needs.
            To keep them engaged, the game must be enjoyable from start to finish,
             as they get bored easily. It should be of a reasonable length because
              short games often miss important elements. Offering various paths, options,
            and unique enemies will make the game more interesting.</p>
        <br>

        <h1>implications</h1>
        <h2>Describe</h2>
        <p> The implications are usablity, asteticts, functionality and interlectual property. astetics is how the game looks and the overall vibe of the game. 
          functionality is weather or not your game actually works and there are little to no bugs. Usablity is how easy your game is to use.
           finally interlectual property is the legel owner ship of an idear. </p>
        <h2>adress</h2>
        <h3>usablity</h3>
        <p> To make sure that my games usablity efficent, I will focus of the controlls of my character and make them hard and difficult to play with for unique gameplay.
          I can acheive by making my character a bird and having to controll every aspect of the wings.
        </p>
        <h3>astetics</h3>
        <p> for astetics I will try and make the character in a unique style so people are drawn to unique gamplay and artstyle.
           I will acheive this by giving my characters a body a bird body but with giant eyes.</p>
        <h3>functionality</h3>
        <p>To make sure that functionality is working well, I will get people to test the character, watch the animation and make the people give me feedback on
          what I could do to make it work better.
        </p>
        <h3>interlectual property</h3>
        <p>With interlectual property I personly don't mind if other people take my modles just as long as they say it was made by me.</p>
